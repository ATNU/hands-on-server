  And bathed every veyne in swich licour,
  Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
  Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth                        5
  Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
  The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
  Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,
  And smale fowles maken melodye,
  That slepen al the night with open yÃ«,                        10
  (So priketh hem nature in hir corages):
  Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
  (And palmers for to seken straunge strondes)
  To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;
  And specially, from every shires ende                         15
  Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,
  The holy blisful martir for to seke,
  That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.
