  Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
  Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth                        5
  Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
  The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
  Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,
  And smale fowles maken melodye,
  That slepen al the night with open yë,                        10
  (So priketh hem nature in hir corages):
  Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
  (And palmers for to seken straunge strondes)
  To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;
  And specially, from every shires ende                         15
  Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,
  The holy blisful martir for to seke,
  That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.

  In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay                           20
  Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage
  To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,
  [2: T. 23-58.]
  At night was come in-to that hostelrye
  Wel nyne and twenty in a companye,
  Of sondry folk, by aventure y-falle                           25
  In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle,
  That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde;
  The chambres and the stables weren wyde,
  And wel we weren esed atte beste.
  And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,                     30
  So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,
  That I was of hir felawshipe anon,
  And made forward erly for to ryse,
  To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse.

  Er that I ferther in this tale pace,
  Me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun,
  To telle yow al the condicioun
  Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
  And whiche they weren, and of what degree;                    40
  And eek in what array that they were inne:
  And at a knight than wol I first biginne.

    A KNIGHT ther was, and that a worthy man,              KNIGHT.
  That fro the tyme that he first bigan
  To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,                             45
  Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.
  Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,
  And therto hadde he riden (no man ferre)
  As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse,
  And ever honoured for his worthinesse.                        50

    49. Hn. Hl. as; _rest_ as in.

    At Alisaundre he was, whan it was wonne;
  Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne
  Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce.
  In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,
  No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.                         55
  In Gernade at the sege eek hadde he be
  Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye.
  At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye,
  [3: T. 59-92.]
  Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See
  At many a noble aryve hadde he be.                            60
  At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,
  And foughten for our feith at Tramissene
  In listes thryes, and ay slayn his foo.
  This ilke worthy knight had been also
  Somtyme with the lord of Palatye,                             65
  Ageyn another hethen in Turkye:
  And evermore he hadde a sovereyn prys.
  And though that he were worthy, he was wys,
  And of his port as meke as is a mayde.
  He never yet no vileinye ne sayde                             70
  In al his lyf, un-to no maner wight.
  He was a verray parfit gentil knight.
  But for to tellen yow of his array,
  His hors were gode, but he was nat gay.
  Of fustian he wered a gipoun                                  75
  Al bismotered with his habergeoun;
  For he was late y-come from his viage,
  And wente for to doon his pilgrimage.

    With him ther was his sone, a yong SQUYER,             SQUYER.
  A lovyere, and a lusty bacheler,                              80
  With lokkes crulle, as they were leyd in presse.
  Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.
  Of his stature he was of evene lengthe,
  And wonderly deliver, and greet of strengthe.
  And he had been somtyme in chivachye,                         85
  In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Picardye,
  And born him wel, as of so litel space,
  In hope to stonden in his lady grace.
  Embrouded was he, as it were a mede
  Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and rede.                    90
  Singinge he was, or floytinge, al the day;
  He was as fresh as is the month of May.
  [4: T. 93-127.]
  Short was his goune, with sleves longe and wyde.
  Wel coude he sitte on hors, and faire ryde.
  He coude songes make and wel endyte,                          95
  Iuste and eek daunce, and wel purtreye and wryte,
  So hote he lovede, that by nightertale
  He sleep namore than dooth a nightingale.
  Curteys he was, lowly, and servisable,
  And carf biforn his fader at the table.                      100

    A YEMAN hadde he, and servaunts namo                    YEMAN.
  At that tyme, for him liste ryde so;
  And he was clad in cote and hood of grene;
  A sheef of pecok-arwes brighte and kene
  Under his belt he bar ful thriftily;                         105
  (Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:
  His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),
  And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe.
  A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage.
  Of wode-craft wel coude he al the usage.                     110
  Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,
  And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,
  And on that other syde a gay daggere,
  Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere;
  A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene.                    115
  An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;
  A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.

    Ther was also a Nonne, a PRIORESSE,                 PRIORESSE.
  That of hir smyling was ful simple and coy;
  Hir gretteste ooth was but by sëynt Loy;                     120
  And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.
  Ful wel she song the service divyne,
  Entuned in hir nose ful semely;
  And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,
  After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,                      125
  For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe.
  At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle;
  [5: T. 128-161.]
  She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,
  Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.
  Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,                  130
  That no drope ne fille up-on hir brest.
  In curteisye was set ful muche hir lest.
  Hir over lippe wyped she so clene,
  That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene
  Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.               135
  Ful semely after hir mete she raughte,
  And sikerly she was of greet disport,
  And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port,
  And peyned hir to countrefete chere
  Of court, and been estatlich of manere,                      140
  And to ben holden digne of reverence.
  But, for to speken of hir conscience,
  She was so charitable and so pitous,
  She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous
  Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.               145
  Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde
  With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed.
  But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,
  Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:
  And al was conscience and tendre herte.                      150
  Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was;
  Hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas;
  Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed;
  But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;
  It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;                       155
  For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.
  Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.
  Of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar
  A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;
  And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene,                 160
  On which ther was first write a crowned A,
  [6: T. 162-195.]
  And after, _Amor vincit omnia._

    A MONK ther was, a fair for the maistrye,                MONK.
  An out-rydere, that lovede venerye;                          166
  A manly man, to been an abbot able.
  Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable:
  And, whan he rood, men mighte his brydel here
  Ginglen in a whistling wind as clere,                        170
  And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle,
  Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.
  The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,
  By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,
  This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,                       175
  And held after the newe world the space.
  He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,
  That seith, that hunters been nat holy men;
  Ne that a monk, whan he is cloisterlees,
  Is lykned til a fish that is waterlees;                      180
  This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre.
  But thilke text held he nat worth an oistre;
  And I seyde, his opinioun was good.
  What sholde he studie, and make him-selven wood,
  Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,                      185
  Or swinken with his handes, and laboure,
  As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?
  Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.
  Therfore he was a pricasour aright;
  Grehoundes he hadde, as swifte as fowel in flight;           190
  Of priking and of hunting for the hare
  Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
  I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond
  With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;
  And, for to festne his hood under his chin,                  195
  [7: T. 196-231.]
  He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin:
  A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.
  His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,
  And eek his face, as he had been anoint.
  He was a lord ful fat and in good point;                     200
  His eyen stepe, and rollinge in his heed,
  That stemed as a forneys of a leed;
  His botes souple, his hors in greet estat.
  Now certeinly he was a fair prelat;
  He was nat pale as a for-pyned goost.                        205
  A fat swan loved he best of any roost.
  His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.

    A FRERE ther was, a wantown and a merye,                FRERE.
  A limitour, a ful solempne man.
  In alle the ordres foure is noon that can                    210
  So muche of daliaunce and fair langage.
  He hadde maad ful many a mariage
  Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.
  Un-to his ordre he was a noble post.
  Ful wel biloved and famulier was he                          215
  With frankeleyns over-al in his contree,
  And eek with worthy wommen of the toun:
  For he had power of confessioun,
  As seyde him-self, more than a curat,
  For of his ordre he was licentiat.                           220
  Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
  And plesaunt was his absolucioun;
  He was an esy man to yeve penaunce
  Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce;
  For unto a povre ordre for to yive                           225
  Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive.
  For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,
  He wiste that a man was repentaunt.
  For many a man so hard is of his herte,
  He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte.                    230
  Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres,
  [8: T. 232-265.]
  Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.
  His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves
  And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves.
  And certeinly he hadde a mery note;                          235
  Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.
  Of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys.
  His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys;
  Ther-to he strong was as a champioun.
  He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,                      240
  And everich hostiler and tappestere
  Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;
  For un-to swich a worthy man as he
  Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
  To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.                       245
  It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce
  For to delen with no swich poraille,
  But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
  And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,
  Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.                        250
  Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.
  He was the beste beggere in his hous;
  [And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt;                   252 b
  Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;]              252 c
  For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
  So plesaunt was his "_In principio_,"
  Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.                   255
  His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.
  And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe.
  In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.                  (260)
  For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer,
  With a thredbar cope, as is a povre scoler,                  260
  But he was lyk a maister or a pope.
  Of double worsted was his semi-cope,
  That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
  [9: T. 266-300.]
  Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,
  To make his English swete up-on his tonge;                   265
  And in his harping, whan that he had songe,
  His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,
  As doon the sterres in the frosty night.                   (270)
  This worthy limitour was cleped Huberd.

  With his bargaynes, and with his chevisaunce.

  Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;                       290
  For he had geten him yet no benefyce,
  Ne was so worldly for to have offyce.
  For him was lever have at his beddes heed
  Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,
  Of Aristotle and his philosophye,                            295
  Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrye.
  But al be that he was a philosophre,
  Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;                      (300)
  [10: T. 301-336.]
  But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,
  On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,                       300
  And bisily gan for the soules preye
  Of hem that yaf him wher-with to scoleye.
  Of studie took he most cure and most hede.
  Noght o word spak he more than was nede,
  And that was seyd in forme and reverence,                    305
  And short and quik, and ful of hy sentence.
  Souninge in moral vertu was his speche,
  And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.               (310)

  That often hadde been at the parvys,                         310
  Ther was also, ful riche of excellence.
  Discreet he was, and of greet reverence:
  He semed swich, his wordes weren so wyse.
  Iustyce he was ful often in assyse,
  By patente, and by pleyn commissioun;                        315
  For his science, and for his heigh renoun
  Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.

  No-wher so bisy a man as he ther nas,
  And yet he semed bisier than he was.
  In termes hadde he caas and domes alle,
  That from the tyme of king William were falle.
  Therto he coude endyte, and make a thing,                    325
  Ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting;
  And every statut coude he pleyn by rote.
  He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote                        (330)

  Whyt was his berd, as is the dayesye.
  Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.
  Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn.
  [11: T. 337-370.]
  To liven in delyt was ever his wone,                         335
  For he was Epicurus owne sone,
  That heeld opinioun, that pleyn delyt
  Was verraily felicitee parfyt.
  An housholdere, and that a greet, was he;                  (340)
  Seint Iulian he was in his contree.
  His breed, his ale, was alwey after oon;
  A bettre envyned man was no-wher noon.
  With-oute bake mete was never his hous,
  Of fish and flesh, and that so plentevous,
  It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke,                    345
  Of alle deyntees that men coude thinke.
  After the sondry sesons of the yeer,
  So chaunged he his mete and his soper.                     (350)
  Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in mewe,
  And many a breem and many a luce in stewe.                   350
  Wo was his cook, but-if his sauce were
  Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his gere.

  Stood redy covered al the longe day.
  At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;                      355
  Ful ofte tyme he was knight of the shire.
  An anlas and a gipser al of silk

  For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.

  In a gowne of falding to the knee.
  A daggere hanging on a laas hadde he

  With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake.
  He knew wel alle the havenes, as they were,
  From Gootlond to the cape of Finistere,                    (410)

    With us ther was a DOCTOUR OF PHISYK,                 DOCTOUR.
  In al this world ne was ther noon him lyk
  To speke of phisik and of surgerye;
  For he was grounded in astronomye.
  He kepte his pacient a ful greet del                         415
  In houres, by his magik naturel.
  Wel coude he fortunen the ascendent
  Of his images for his pacient.                             (420)
  He knew the cause of everich maladye,
  Were it of hoot or cold, or moiste, or drye,                 420
  And where engendred, and of what humour;
  He was a verrey parfit practisour.
  The cause y-knowe, and of his harm the rote,
  Anon he yaf the seke man his bote.
  Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries,                          425
  To sende him drogges and his letuaries,
  For ech of hem made other for to winne;
  Hir frendschipe nas nat newe to biginne.                   (430)

  For it was of no superfluitee,
  But of greet norissing and digestible.
  His studie was but litel on the Bible.                     (440)
  In sangwin and in pers he clad was al,
  [14: T. 442-478.]
  Lyned with taffata and with sendal;                          440
  And yet he was but esy of dispence;

    A good WYF was ther of bisyde BATHE,             WYF OF BATHE.
  But she was som-del deef, and that was scathe.               446
  Of clooth-making she hadde swiche an haunt,
  She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt.                      (450)
  In al the parisshe wyf ne was ther noon
  That to the offring bifore hir sholde goon;                  450
  And if ther dide, certeyn, so wrooth was she,
  That she was out of alle charitee.
  Hir coverchiefs ful fyne were of ground;

  That on a Sonday were upon hir heed.                         455
  Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed,

  She was a worthy womman al hir lyve,
  Housbondes at chirche-dore she hadde fyve,                   460
  Withouten other companye in youthe;
  But therof nedeth nat to speke as nouthe.

  At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne,                     465
  In Galice at seint Iame, and at Coloigne.
  She coude muche of wandring by the weye.
  Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye.                   (470)
  Up-on an amblere esily she sat,
  Y-wimpled wel, and on hir heed an hat                        470
  As brood as is a bokeler or a targe;
  A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large,

  In felawschip wel coude she laughe and carpe.

    A good man was ther of religioun,                     PERSOUN.
  And was a povre PERSOUN of a toun;                         (480)
  But riche he was of holy thoght and werk.
  He was also a lerned man, a clerk,                           480
  That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;
  His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.
  Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,
  And in adversitee ful pacient;
  And swich he was y-preved ofte sythes.                       485
  Ful looth were him to cursen for his tythes,
  But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,
  Un-to his povre parisshens aboute                          (490)
  Of his offring, and eek of his substaunce.
  He coude in litel thing han suffisaunce.                     490
  Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer a-sonder,
  But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder,
  In siknes nor in meschief, to visyte
  The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lyte,
  Up-on his feet, and in his hand a staf.                      495
  This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf,
  That first he wroghte, and afterward he taughte;
  Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte;                   (500)
  And this figure he added eek ther-to,
  That if gold ruste, what shal iren do?                       500
  For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste,
  No wonder is a lewed man to ruste;
  And shame it is, if a preest take keep,
  A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep.
  Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive,                     505
  By his clennesse, how that his sheep shold live.
  He sette nat his benefice to hyre,
  And leet his sheep encombred in the myre,                  (510)
  And ran to London, un-to sëynt Poules,
  To seken him a chaunterie for soules,                        510
  Or with a bretherhed to been withholde;
  [16: T. 514-547.]
  But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,
  So that the wolf ne made it nat miscarie;
  He was a shepherde and no mercenarie.
  And though he holy were, and vertuous,                       515
  He was to sinful man nat despitous,
  Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne,
  But in his teching discreet and benigne.                   (520)
  To drawen folk to heven by fairnesse
  By good ensample, was his bisinesse:                         520
  But it were any persone obstinat,
  What-so he were, of heigh or lowe estat,
  Him wolde he snibben sharply for the nones.
  A bettre preest, I trowe that nowher noon is.
  He wayted after no pompe and reverence,                      525
  Ne maked him a spyced conscience,
  But Cristes lore, and his apostles twelve,
  He taughte, and first he folwed it him-selve.              (530)

    The MILLER was a stout carl, for the nones,            MILLER.
  [17: T. 548-582.]
  Ful big he was of braun, and eek of bones;                   546
  That proved wel, for over-al ther he cam,
  At wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram.                  (550)
  He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre,
  Ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre,                550
  Or breke it, at a renning, with his heed.
  His berd as any sowe or fox was reed,
  And ther-to brood, as though it were a spade.
  Up-on the cop right of his nose he hade
  A werte, and ther-on stood a tuft of heres,                  555
  Reed as the bristles of a sowes eres;
  His nose-thirles blake were and wyde.
  A swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde;                    (560)
  His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys.
  He was a Ianglere and a goliardeys,                          560
  And that was most of sinne and harlotryes.
  Wel coude he stelen corn, and tollen thryes;

    A gentil MAUNCIPLE was ther of a temple,            MAUNCIPLE.
  Of which achatours mighte take exemple                     (570)
  For to be wyse in bying of vitaille.

    The REVE was a sclendre colerik man,                     REVE.
  His berd was shave as ny as ever he can.                   (590)
  His heer was by his eres round y-shorn.
  His top was dokked lyk a preest biforn.                      590
  Ful longe were his legges, and ful lene,
  Y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene.
  Wel coude he kepe a gerner and a binne;
  Ther was noon auditour coude on him winne.
  Wel wiste he, by the droghte, and by the reyn,               595
  The yelding of his seed, and of his greyn.
  His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye,
  His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye,            (600)
  Was hoolly in this reves governing,
  And by his covenaunt yaf the rekening,                       600
  Sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age;
  Ther coude no man bringe him in arrerage.
  Ther nas baillif, ne herde, ne other hyne,
  That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne;
  They were adrad of him, as of the deeth.                     605
  His woning was ful fair up-on an heeth,
  With grene treës shadwed was his place.
  He coude bettre than his lord purchace.                    (610)
  Ful riche he was astored prively,
  His lord wel coude he plesen subtilly,                       610
  To yeve and lene him of his owne good,
  And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood.
  In youthe he lerned hadde a good mister;
  [19: T. 616-652.]
  He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter.
  This reve sat up-on a ful good stot,                         615
  That was al pomely grey, and highte Scot.
  A long surcote of pers up-on he hade,
  And by his syde he bar a rusty blade.                      (620)
  Of Northfolk was this reve, of which I telle,
  Bisyde a toun men clepen Baldeswelle.                        620
  Tukked he was, as is a frere, aboute,
  And ever he rood the hindreste of our route.

    A SOMNOUR was ther with us in that place,             SOMNOUR.
  That hadde a fyr-reed cherubinnes face,
  For sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe.                      625
  As hoot he was, and lecherous, as a sparwe;
  With scalled browes blake, and piled berd;
  Of his visage children were aferd.                         (630)
  Ther nas quik-silver, litarge, ne brimstoon,
  Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon,                      630
  Ne oynement that wolde dense and byte,
  That him mighte helpen of his whelkes whyte,
  Nor of the knobbes sittinge on his chekes.
  Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes,
  And for to drinken strong wyn, reed as blood.                635
  Thanne wolde he speke, and crye as he were wood.
  And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,
  Than wolde he speke no word but Latyn.                     (640)
  A fewe termes hadde he, two or three,
  That he had lerned out of som decree;                        640
  No wonder is, he herde it al the day;
  And eek ye knowen wel, how that a Iay
  Can clepen 'Watte,' as well as can the pope.
  But who-so coude in other thing him grope,
  Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophye;                    645
  Ay '_Questio quid iuris_' wolde he crye.
  He was a gentil harlot and a kinde;
  A bettre felawe sholde men noght finde.                    (650)
  He wolde suffre, for a quart of wyn,
  A good felawe to have his concubyn                           650
  [20: T. 653-687.]
  A twelf-month, and excuse him atte fulle:
  Ful prively a finch eek coude he pulle.
  And if he fond o-wher a good felawe,
  He wolde techen him to have non awe,
  In swich cas, of the erchedeknes curs,                       655
  But-if a mannes soule were in his purs;
  For in his purs he sholde y-punisshed be.
  'Purs is the erchedeknes helle,' seyde he.                 (660)
  But wel I woot he lyed right in dede;
  Of cursing oghte ech gilty man him drede--                   660
  For curs wol slee, right as assoilling saveth--
  And also war him of a _significavit_.
  In daunger hadde he at his owne gyse
  The yonge girles of the diocyse,
  And knew hir counseil, and was al hir reed.                  665
  A gerland hadde he set up-on his heed,
  As greet as it were for an ale-stake;
  A bokeler hadde he maad him of a cake.                     (670)

    With him ther rood a gentil PARDONER                 PARDONER.
  Of Rouncival, his freend and his compeer,                    670
  That streight was comen fro the court of Rome.
  Ful loude he song, 'Com hider, love, to me.'
  This somnour bar to him a stif burdoun,
  Was never trompe of half so greet a soun.
  This pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,                    675
  But smothe it heng, as dooth a strike of flex;
  By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,
  And ther-with he his shuldres overspradde;                 (680)
  But thinne it lay, by colpons oon and oon;
  But hood, for Iolitee, ne wered he noon,                     680
  For it was trussed up in his walet.
  Him thoughte, he rood al of the newe Iet;
  Dischevele, save his cappe, he rood al bare.
  Swiche glaringe eyen hadde he as an hare.
  A vernicle hadde he sowed on his cappe.                      685
  [21: T. 688-722.]
  His walet lay biforn him in his lappe,
  Bret-ful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot.
  A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot.                    (690)
  No berd hadde he, ne never sholde have,
  As smothe it was as it were late y-shave;                    690
  I trowe he were a gelding or a mare.
  But of his craft, fro Berwik into Ware,
  Ne was ther swich another pardoner.
  For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer,
  Which that, he seyde, was our lady veyl:                     695
  He seyde, he hadde a gobet of the seyl
  That sëynt Peter hadde, whan that he wente
  Up-on the see, til Iesu Crist him hente.                   (700)
  He hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones,
  And in a glas he hadde pigges bones.                         700
  But with thise relikes, whan that he fond
  A povre person dwelling up-on lond,
  Up-on a day he gat him more moneye
  Than that the person gat in monthes tweye.
  And thus, with feyned flaterye and Iapes,                    705
  He made the person and the peple his apes.
  But trewely to tellen, atte laste,
  He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste.                     (710)
  Wel coude he rede a lessoun or a storie,
  But alderbest he song an offertorie;                         710
  For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe,
  He moste preche, and wel affyle his tonge,
  To winne silver, as he ful wel coude;
  Therefore he song so meriely and loude.

  Why that assembled was this companye
  In Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye,                    (720)

  But now is tyme to yow for to telle                          720

  How that we baren us that ilke night,
  Whan we were in that hostelrye alight.
  And after wol I telle of our viage,

  For this ye knowen al-so wel as I,                           730
  Who-so shal telle a tale after a man,
  He moot reherce, as ny as ever he can,
  Everich a word, if it be in his charge,
  Al speke he never so rudeliche and large;
  Or elles he moot telle his tale untrewe,                     735
  Or feyne thing, or finde wordes newe.
  He may nat spare, al-thogh he were his brother;
  He moot as wel seye o word as another.                     (740)
  Crist spak him-self ful brode in holy writ,
  And wel ye woot, no vileinye is it.                          740
  Eek Plato seith, who-so that can him rede,
  The wordes mote be cosin to the dede.
  Also I prey yow to foryeve it me,
  Al have I nat set folk in hir degree

  And served us with vitaille at the beste.
  Strong was the wyn, and wel to drinke us leste.              750

  _Iamque domos patrias, Scithice post aspera gentis_
  _Prelia, laurigero, &c._
                          [Statius, _Theb._ xii. 519.]

  Whylom, as olde stories tellen us,
  Ther was a duk that highte Theseus;                          860
  Of Athenes he was lord and governour,
  And in his tyme swich a conquerour,
  That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
  Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
  What with his wisdom and his chivalrye,                      865
  He conquered al the regne of Femenye,
  That whylom was y-cleped Scithia;
  And weddede the quene Ipolita,                              (10)
  And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree
  With muchel glorie and greet solempnitee,                    870
  And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
  And thus with victorie and with melodye
  Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ryde,
  And al his hoost, in armes, him bisyde.

  How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
  By Theseus, and by his chivalrye;                           (20)
  And of the grete bataille for the nones
  Bitwixen Athenës and Amazones;                               880
  And how asseged was Ipolita,
  The faire hardy quene of Scithia;
  And of the feste that was at hir weddinge,
  [27: T. 886-921.]
  And of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge;
  But al that thing I moot as now forbere.                     885

  And wayke been the oxen in my plough.

  When he was come almost unto the toun,
  In al his wele and in his moste pryde,                       895
  He was war, as he caste his eye asyde,
  Wher that ther kneled in the hye weye
  A companye of ladies, tweye and tweye,                      (40)
  Ech after other, clad in clothes blake;
  But swich a cry and swich a wo they make,                    900
  That in this world nis creature livinge,
  That herde swich another weymentinge;
  And of this cry they nolde never stenten,

  Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye?                (50)
  Or who hath yow misboden, or offended?
  And telleth me if it may been amended;                       910
  And why that ye ben clothed thus in blak?'

    The eldest lady of hem alle spak,
  When she hadde swowned with a deedly chere,
  That it was routhe for to seen and here,
  And seyde: 'Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven                 915
  Victorie, and as a conquerour to liven,
  Noght greveth us your glorie and your honour;
  But we biseken mercy and socour.                            (60)

  And alle we, that been in this array,

  And in his armes he hem alle up hente,
  And hem conforteth in ful good entente;                    (100)
  And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knight,

  Thus rit this duk, thus rit this conquerour,
  And in his host of chivalrye the flour,

  But shortly for to speken of this thing,                     985
  With Creon, which that was of Thebes king,
  He faught, and slough him manly as a knight
  In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flight;           (130)
  And by assaut he wan the citee after,
  And rente adoun bothe wal, and sparre, and rafter;           990
  And to the ladyes he restored agayn
  The bones of hir housbondes that were slayn,
  To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.
  [30: T. 996-1031.]
  But it were al to long for to devyse

  That the ladyes made at the brenninge
  Of the bodyes, and the grete honour
  That Theseus, the noble conquerour,                        (140)
  Doth to the ladyes, whan they from him wente;
  But shortly for to telle is myn entente.                    1000
  Whan that this worthy duk, this Theseus,
  Hath Creon slayn, and wonne Thebes thus,

  And so bifel, that in the tas they founde,

  Two yonge knightes ligging by and by,
  Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely,

  Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene,
  And fressher than the May with floures newe--
  For with the rose colour stroof hir hewe,                  (180)
  I noot which was the fairer of hem two--
  Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,                      1040
  She was arisen, and al redy dight;
  For May wol have no slogardye a-night.
  The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,
  And maketh him out of his sleep to sterte,
  And seith, 'Arys, and do thyn observaunce.'                 1045
  This maked Emelye have remembraunce
  To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.
  Y-clothed was she fresh, for to devyse;                    (190)
  Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse,
  Bihinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse.                     1050
  And in the gardin, at the sonne up-riste,
  She walketh up and doun, and as hir liste
  She gadereth floures, party whyte and rede,
  To make a sotil gerland for hir hede,
  And as an aungel hevenly she song.                          1055

  Of whiche I tolde yow, and tellen shal)

  Bright was the sonne, and cleer that morweninge,
  And Palamon, this woful prisoner,
  As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,
  [32: T. 1067-1103.]
  Was risen, and romed in a chambre on heigh,                 1065
  In which he al the noble citee seigh,
  And eek the gardin, ful of braunches grene,
  Ther-as this fresshe Emelye the shene                      (210)
  Was in hir walk, and romed up and doun.
  This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,                      1070

  And to him-self compleyning of his wo;

  And so bifel, by aventure or cas,
  That thurgh a window, thikke of many a barre                1075
  Of yren greet, and square as any sparre,

  And ther-with-al he bleynte, and cryde 'a!'                (220)
  As though he stongen were un-to the herte.
  And with that cry Arcite anon up-sterte,                    1080
  And seyde, 'Cosin myn, what eyleth thee,
  That art so pale and deedly on to see?
  Why crydestow? who hath thee doon offence?
  For Goddes love, tak al in pacience
  Our prisoun, for it may non other be;                       1085

  The fairnesse of that lady that I see                      (240)

  A worthy duk that highte Perotheus,
  That felawe was un-to duk Theseus
  Sin thilke day that they were children lyte,
  Was come to Athenes, his felawe to visyte,
  And for to pleye, as he was wont to do,                     1195
  For in this world he loved no man so:
  And he loved him as tendrely ageyn.
  So wel they loved, as olde bokes seyn,                     (340)

  Duk Perotheus loved wel Arcite,
  And hadde him knowe at Thebes yeer by yere;
  And fynally, at requeste and preyere
  Of Perotheus, with-oute any raunsoun,                       1205
  Duk Theseus him leet out of prisoun,

  That if so were, that Arcite were y-founde
  Ever in his lyf, by day or night or stounde
  In any contree of this Theseus,
  And he were caught, it was acorded thus,
  That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed;                  1215
  Ther nas non other remedye ne reed,
  But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde;

    Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,                     1355
  Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde 'allas,'
  For seen his lady shal he never-mo.
  And shortly to concluden al his wo,                        (500)
  So muche sorwe had never creature
  That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.             1360
  His sleep, his mete, his drink is him biraft,
  That lene he wex, and drye as is a shaft.
  His eyen holwe, and grisly to biholde;
  His hewe falwe, and pale as asshen colde,
  And solitarie he was, and ever allone,                      1365
  And wailling al the night, making his mone.
  And if he herde song or instrument,
  Then wolde he wepe, he mighte nat be stent;                (510)
  So feble eek were his spirits, and so lowe,
  And chaunged so, that no man coude knowe                    1370
  His speche nor his vois, though men it herde.
  And in his gere, for al the world he ferde
  Nat oonly lyk the loveres maladye
  Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye
  Engendred of humour malencolyk,                             1375
  Biforen, in his celle fantastyk.
  And shortly, turned was al up-so-doun

    What sholde I al-day of his wo endyte?                    1380
  Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
  This cruel torment, and this peyne and wo,
  At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,
  Up-on a night, in sleep as he him leyde,
  [41: T. 1387-1424.]
  Him thoughte how that the winged god Mercurie               1385
  Biforn him stood, and bad him to be murye.
  His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;
  An hat he werede up-on his heres brighte.                  (530)
  Arrayed was this god (as he took keep)
  As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;                   1390
  And seyde him thus: 'To Athenes shaltou wende;
  Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.'
  And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
  'Now trewely, how sore that me smerte,'
  Quod he, 'to Athenes right now wol I fare;                  1395
  Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
  To see my lady, that I love and serve;
  In hir presence I recche nat to sterve.'                   (540)

  And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,                  1400
  And saugh his visage al in another kinde.
  And right anoon it ran him in his minde,
  That, sith his face was so disfigured
  Of maladye, the which he hadde endured,
  He mighte wel, if that he bar him lowe,                     1405
  Live in Athenes ever-more unknowe,
  And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
  And right anon he chaunged his array,                      (550)
  And cladde him as a povre laborer,
  And al allone, save oonly a squyer,                         1410
  That knew his privetee and al his cas,
  Which was disgysed povrely, as he was,
  To Athenes is he goon the nexte way.
  And to the court he wente up-on a day,
  And at the gate he profreth his servyse,                    1415
  To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.
  And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
  He fil in office with a chamberleyn,                       (560)
  The which that dwelling was with Emelye.
  For he was wys, and coude soon aspye                        1420
  Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.
  Wel coude he hewen wode, and water bere,
  [42: T. 1425-1461.]
  For he was yong and mighty for the nones,
  And ther-to be was strong and big of bones
  To doon that any wight can him devyse.                      1425
  A yeer or two he was in this servyse,
  Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte;
  And 'Philostrate' he seide that he highte.                 (570)
  But half so wel biloved a man as he
  Ne was ther never in court, of his degree;                  1430
  He was so gentil of condicioun,
  That thurghout al the court was his renoun.
  They seyden, that it were a charitee
  That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,
  And putten him in worshipful servyse,                       1435
  Ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse.
  And thus, with-inne a whyle, his name is spronge
  Bothe of his dedes, and his goode tonge,                   (580)
  That Theseus hath taken him so neer
  That of his chambre he made him a squyer,                   1440
  And yaf him gold to mayntene his degree;
  And eek men broghte him out of his contree
  From yeer to yeer, ful prively, his rente;
  But honestly and slyly he it spente,
  That no man wondred how that he it hadde.                   1445
  And three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde,
  And bar him so in pees and eek in werre,
  Ther nas no man that Theseus hath derre.                   (590)
  And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,

  The thridde night, (as olde bokes seyn,
  That al this storie tellen more pleyn,)
  Were it by aventure or destinee,                            1465
  (As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,)
  That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
  By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,                  (610)
  And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
  For he had yive his gayler drinke so                        1470
  Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,
  With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
  That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,
  The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;
  And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.                 1475
  The night was short, and faste by the day,
  That nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde,
  And til a grove, faste ther besyde,                        (620)
  With dredful foot than stalketh Palamoun.
  For shortly, this was his opinioun,                         1480
  That in that grove he wolde him hyde al day,
  And in the night than wolde he take his way
  To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye
  On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;
  And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lyf,                  1485
  Or winnen Emelye un-to his wyf;
  This is theffect and his entente pleyn.

  And to the grove, of which that I yow tolde,                1505

  To maken him a gerland of the greves,
  Were it of wodebinde or hawethorn-leves,                   (650)

  Wel-come be thou, faire fresshe May,
  I hope that I som grene gete may.'
  And from his courser, with a lusty herte,

    This Palamon answerde hastily,
  And seyde: 'sire, what nedeth wordes mo?                    1715
  We have the deeth deserved bothe two.
  Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,
  That been encombred of our owne lyves;                     (860)
  And as thou art a rightful lord and Iuge,
  Ne yeve us neither mercy ne refuge,                         1720
  But slee me first, for seynte charitee;
  But slee my felawe eek as wel as me.
  Or slee him first; for, though thou knowe it lyte,
  This is thy mortal fo, this is Arcite,
  That fro thy lond is banished on his heed,                  1725
  For which he hath deserved to be deed.
  For this is he that cam un-to thy gate,
  And seyde, that he highte Philostrate.                     (870)
  Thus hath he Iaped thee ful many a yeer,
  And thou has maked him thy chief squyer;                    1730
  And this is he that loveth Emelye.
  For sith the day is come that I shal dye,
  I make pleynly my confessioun,
  That I am thilke woful Palamoun,
  That hath thy prison broken wikkedly.                       1735
  I am thy mortal fo, and it am I
  That loveth so hote Emelye the brighte,
  That I wol dye present in hir sighte.                      (880)
  Therfore I axe deeth and my Iuwyse;
  But slee my felawe in the same wyse,                        1740

    This worthy duk answerde anon agayn,
  And seyde, 'This is a short conclusioun:
  Youre owne mouth, by your confessioun,
  Hath dampned you, and I wol it recorde,                     1745
  It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.
  Ye shul be deed, by mighty Mars the rede!'
  [51: T. 1750-1787.]
  The quene anon, for verray wommanhede,                     (890)
  Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,
  And alle the ladies in the companye.                        1750
  Gret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
  That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle;
  For gentil men they were, of greet estat,
  And no-thing but for love was this debat;
  And sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore;                   1755
  And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more,
  'Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!'
  And on hir bare knees adoun they falle,                    (900)
  And wolde have kist his feet ther-as he stood,
  Til at the laste aslaked was his mood;                      1760
  For pitee renneth sone in gentil herte.
  And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
  He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
  The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause:
  And al-though that his ire hir gilt accused,                1765
  Yet in his reson he hem bothe excused;
  As thus: he thoghte wel, that every man
  Wol helpe him-self in love, if that he can,                (910)
  And eek delivere him-self out of prisoun;
  And eek his herte had compassioun                           1770
  Of wommen, for they wepen ever in oon;
  And in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon,
  And softe un-to himself he seyde: 'fy
  Up-on a lord that wol have no mercy,
  But been a leoun, bothe in word and dede,                   1775
  To hem that been in repentaunce and drede
  As wel as to a proud despitous man
  That wol maynteyne that he first bigan!                    (920)
  That lord hath litel of discrecioun,
  That in swich cas can no divisioun,                         1780
  But weyeth pryde and humblesse after oon.'
  And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
  He gan to loken up with eyen lighte,
  And spak thise same wordes al on highte:--
  The god of love, a! _benedicite_,                           1785
  [52: T. 1788-1823.]
  How mighty and how greet a lord is he!
  Ayeins his might ther gayneth none obstacles,
  He may be cleped a god for his miracles;                   (930)
  For he can maken at his owne gyse
  Of everich herte, as that him list devyse.                  1790
  Lo heer, this Arcite and this Palamoun,
  That quitly weren out of my prisoun,
  And mighte han lived in Thebes royally,
  And witen I am hir mortal enemy,
  And that hir deeth lyth in my might also,                   1795
  And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,
  Y-broght hem hider bothe for to dye!
  Now loketh, is nat that an heigh folye?                    (940)
  Who may been a fool, but-if he love?
  Bihold, for Goddes sake that sit above,                     1800
  Se how they blede! be they noght wel arrayed?
  Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, y-payed
  Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!
  And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse
  That serven love, for aught that may bifalle!               1805
  But this is yet the beste game of alle,
  That she, for whom they han this Iolitee,
  Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me;                     (950)
  She woot namore of al this hote fare,
  By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!                      1810
  But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold;
  A man mot been a fool, or yong or old;
  I woot it by my-self ful yore agoon:
  For in my tyme a servant was I oon.
  And therfore, sin I knowe of loves peyne,                   1815
  And woot how sore it can a man distreyne,
  As he that hath ben caught ofte in his las,
  I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespas,                      (960)
  At requeste of the quene that kneleth here,

  But been my freendes in al that ye may;
  I yow foryeve this trespas every del.'                      1825
  And they him swore his axing fayre and wel,
  And him of lordshipe and of mercy preyde,

    I trowe men wolde deme it necligence,
  If I foryete to tellen the dispence
  Of Theseus, that goth so bisily
  To maken up the listes royally;
  That swich a noble theatre as it was,                       1885
  I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas.
  The circuit a myle was aboute,
  Walled of stoon, and diched al with-oute.                 (1030)
  Round was the shap, in maner of compas,
  Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas,                   1890
  [55: T. 1893-1928.]
  That, whan a man was set on o degree,
  He letted nat his felawe for to see.

    Est-ward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt,
  West-ward, right swich another in the opposit.
  And shortly to concluden, swich a place                     1895
  Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space;
  For in the lond ther nas no crafty man,
  That geometrie or ars-metrik can,                         (1040)
  Ne purtreyour, ne kerver of images,
  That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages                      1900
  The theatre for to maken and devyse.
  And for to doon his ryte and sacrifyse,
  He est-ward hath, up-on the gate above,
  In worship of Venus, goddesse of love,
  Don make an auter and an oratorie;                          1905
  And west-ward, in the minde and in memorie
  Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,
  That coste largely of gold a fother.                      (1050)
  And north-ward, in a touret on the wal,
  Of alabastre whyt and reed coral                            1910
  An oratorie riche for to see,
  In worship of Dyane of chastitee,
  Hath Theseus don wroght in noble wyse.

    But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse
  The noble kerving, and the portreitures,                    1915
  The shap, the countenaunce, and the figures,
  That weren in thise oratories three.

    First in the temple of Venus maystow see                (1060)
  Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
  The broken slepes, and the sykes colde;                     1920
  The sacred teres, and the waymenting;
  The fyry strokes of the desiring,
  That loves servaunts in this lyf enduren;
  The othes, that hir covenants assuren;
  Plesaunce and hope, desyr, fool-hardinesse,                 1925
  Beautee and youthe, bauderie, richesse,
  [56: T. 1929-1963.]
  Charmes and force, lesinges, flaterye,
  Dispense, bisynesse, and Ielousye,                        (1070)
  That wered of yelwe goldes a gerland,
  And a cokkow sitting on hir hand;                           1930
  Festes, instruments, caroles, daunces,
  Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces
  Of love, whiche that I rekne and rekne shal,
  By ordre weren peynted on the wal,
  And mo than I can make of mencioun.                         1935
  For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun,
  Ther Venus hath hir principal dwelling,
  Was shewed on the wal in portreying,                      (1080)
  With al the gardin, and the lustinesse.
  Nat was foryeten the porter Ydelnesse,                      1940
  Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon,
  Ne yet the folye of king Salamon,
  Ne yet the grete strengthe of Hercules--
  Thenchauntements of Medea and Circes--
  Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,                  1945
  The riche Cresus, caytif in servage.
  Thus may ye seen that wisdom ne richesse,
  Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe, ne hardinesse,            (1090)
  Ne may with Venus holde champartye;
  For as hir list the world than may she gye.                 1950
  Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las,
  Til they for wo ful ofte seyde 'allas!'

    The statue of Venus, glorious for to see,                 1955
  Was naked fleting in the large see,
  And fro the navele doun all covered was
  With wawes grene, and brighte as any glas.                (1100)
  A citole in hir right hand hadde she,
  And on hir heed, ful semely for to see,                     1960
  A rose gerland, fresh and wel smellinge;
  [57: T. 1964-1997.]
  Above hir heed hir dowves flikeringe.
  Biforn hir stood hir sone Cupido,

    Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al
  The portreiture, that was up-on the wal                   (1110)
  With-inne the temple of mighty Mars the rede?
  Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,               1970
  Lyk to the estres of the grisly place,
  That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
  In thilke colde frosty regioun,
  Ther-as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.

    First on the wal was peynted a foreste,                   1975
  In which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste,
  With knotty knarry bareyn treës olde
  Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde;                  (1120)
  In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough,
  As though a storm sholde bresten every bough:               1980
  And downward from an hille, under a bente,
  Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente,
  Wroght al of burned steel, of which thentree
  Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.
  And ther-out cam a rage and such a vese,                    1985
  That it made al the gates for to rese.
  The northren light in at the dores shoon,
  For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon,                  (1130)
  Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
  The dores were alle of adamant eterne,                      1990
  Y-clenched overthwart and endelong
  With iren tough; and, for to make it strong,
  Every piler, the temple to sustene,
  Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.

  [58: T. 1998-2033.]
  Of felonye, and al the compassing;
  The cruel ire, reed as any glede;
  The pykepurs, and eek the pale drede;                     (1140)
  The smyler with the knyf under the cloke;
  The shepne brenning with the blake smoke;                   2000
  The treson of the mordring in the bedde;
  The open werre, with woundes al bi-bledde;
  Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace;
  Al ful of chirking was that sory place.
  The sleere of him-self yet saugh I ther,                    2005
  His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer;
  The nayl y-driven in the shode a-night;
  The colde deeth, with mouth gaping up-right.              (1150)
  Amiddes of the temple sat meschaunce,
  With disconfort and sory contenaunce.                       2010
  Yet saugh I woodnesse laughing in his rage;
  Armed compleint, out-hees, and fiers outrage.
  The careyne in the bush, with throte y-corve:
  A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm y-storve;
  The tiraunt, with the prey by force y-raft;                 2015
  The toun destroyed, ther was no-thing laft.
  Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres;
  The hunte strangled with the wilde beres:                 (1160)
  The sowe freten the child right in the cradel;
  The cook y-scalded, for al his longe ladel.                 2020

  The carter over-riden with his carte,

  Ther shiveren shaftes up-on sheeldes thikke;                2605
  He feleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke.
  Up springen speres twenty foot on highte;
  Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte.               (1750)
  The helmes they to-hewen and to-shrede;
  Out brest the blood, with sterne stremes rede.              2610
  With mighty maces the bones they to-breste.
  He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste.

  [75: T. 2618-2655.]
  And he him hurtleth with his hors adoun.

  As forward was, right ther he moste abyde;
  Another lad is on that other syde.                          2620
  And som tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste,

  So cruel on the hunte, as is Arcite                       (1770)
  For Ielous herte upon this Palamoun:
  Ne in Belmarye ther nis so fel leoun,                       2630

  Ne of his praye desireth so the blood,

  And made his swerd depe in his flesh to byte;               2640
  And by the force of twenty is he take

  And in the rescous of this Palamoun
  The stronge king Ligurge is born adoun;
  And king Emetreus, for al his strengthe,                    2645
  Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
  So hitte him Palamon er he were take;
  But al for noght, he was broght to the stake.             (1790)
  His hardy herte mighte him helpe naught;

  Un-to the folk that foghten thus echoon                     2655
  He cryde, 'Ho! namore, for it is doon!

  Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelye,                        (1800)

  Is comen hoom to Athenes his citee,
  With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.
  Al be it that this aventure was falle,

  Men seyde eek, that Arcite shal nat dye;                    2705
  He shal ben heled of his maladye.
  And of another thing they were as fayn,
  That of hem alle was ther noon y-slayn,                   (1850)
  Al were they sore y-hurt, and namely oon,
  That with a spere was thirled his brest-boon.               2710

  For which this noble duk, as he wel can,                    2715

  And made revel al the longe night,
  Un-to the straunge lordes, as was right.                  (1860)

  How they weren feld, shal nat be told for me;
  Ne how the goddes ronnen up and doun,                       2925
  Disherited of hir habitacioun,
  In which they woneden in reste and pees,

  Ne how the bestes and the briddes alle

  Ne how the ground agast was of the light,
  That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright;
  Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree,
  And than with drye stokkes cloven a three,
  And than with grene wode and spycerye,                      2935
  And than with cloth of gold and with perrye,
  And gerlandes hanging with ful many a flour,
  The mirre, thencens, with al so greet odour;              (2080)

  And cuppes ful of wyn, and milk, and blood,
  Into the fyr, that brente as it were wood;                  2950
  Ne how the Grekes with an huge route
  Thryës riden al the fyr aboute
  Up-on the left hand, with a loud shoutinge,
  And thryës with hir speres clateringe;
  And thryës how the ladies gonne crye;                       2955

  Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde;

  The wake-pleyes, ne kepe I nat to seye;                     2960
  Who wrastleth best naked, with oille enoynt,
  Ne who that bar him best, in no disioynt.
  I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon
  Hoom til Athenes, whan the pley is doon;
  But shortly to the poynt than wol I wende,                  2965

  Than semed me ther was a parlement                          2970
  At Athenes, up-on certeyn poynts and cas;
  Among the whiche poynts y-spoken was
  To have with certeyn contrees alliaunce,
  And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.
  For which this noble Theseus anon                           2975
  Leet senden after gentil Palamon,
  Unwist of him what was the cause and why;
  But in his blake clothes sorwefully                       (2120)
  He cam at his comaundement in hye.
  Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.                               2980
  Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,
  And Theseus abiden hadde a space
  Er any word cam from his wyse brest,
  His eyen sette he ther as was his lest,
  [85: T. 2987-3020.]
  And with a sad visage he syked stille,                      2985
  And after that right thus he seyde his wille.

    'The firste moevere of the cause above,
  Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,              (2130)
  Greet was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
  Wel wiste he why, and what ther-of he mente;                2990

  The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond
